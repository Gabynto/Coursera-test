	<h3>COMPUTER GENERATION</h3>Generation in computer technology is a change in technology a computer is/was being used. Initially, the term GENERATION was used to distinguish between varying hardware and software, which together make up an entire computer system. 
	There are totally five computer generations known till date. Each generation discussed in detail along with their time period and characteristics. Here approximate dates against each generations have been mentioned which are normally accepted. Following are the main five generations of Computers.
	GENERATION AND DESCRIPTION
	The period of first generation was 1946-1959.The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry tora CPU (Central processing Unit).
These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and were prone to frequent fusing of the installations, therefore, were very expensive and could be afforded only by very large organizations. In this generation mainly batch processing operating system were used, punched cards, paper tape and magnetic tape were used as input and output devices. The computers in this generation used machine code as programming language.The period of second generation was 1959-1965. In this generation transistors were used that were cheaper, consumed less power more compact in size, more reliable and faster than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were used as primary memory and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices in this generation assembly language like FOTRAN, COLBOL were used, the computer used batch processing and multi programming operating system. The main features of second generation are;
1)	Use of transistors
2)	Reliable in comparison to first generation computers.
3)	Smaller size as compared to first generation computers
4)	Generated less heat as compared to first generation computers 
5)	Consumed less electricity as compared to first generation 
6)	Faster than first generation computers 
7)	Still very expensive
8)	Air Conditioner needed
9)	Supported machine and assembly languages 
Some computers of this generation are 
1)	IBM 1620
2)	IBM 7094
3)	CDC 1904
4)	CDC 3600
5)	UNIVAC 1108The period of third generation was 1965 – 1971. The computer of third generation used integrated Circuits (IC’s) in place of transistors. A single IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable and efficient. In this generation remote processing, time-sharing, multi-programming operating operating system were used. High level languages (FORTRAN TO \v, COBOL, PASCAL PL/I, BASIC, ALGOL-68) were used to use during this generation.
	The main features of third generation computers are;
1)	IC used
2)	More reliable in comparison to previous two generations
3)	Smaller size
4)	Generated less heat.
5)	Faster 
6)	Lesser maintenance
7)	Still costly
8)	Air conditioner 
9)	Consumed lesser electricity 
10)	Supported high-level language.
Some computers of this generation were;
1)	IBM-360 series 
2)	Honeywell-6000 series
3)	PDP (Personal Data processor)
4)	IBM-370/168
5)	TDC-316
The period of fourth generation was 1971-1980. The computers of fourth generation used very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit element and their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have micro computers of fourth generation. Fourth generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable and affordable. As a result, it gave rise to personal computers (PC) revolution. In this generation time sharing, real time, networks distributed operating system were used. All the high-level languages like C, C++, D BASE e.t.c were used in this generation.
	THE MAIN FEATURES OF FOURTH GENERATIONS ARE
1) VLSI technology used
2) Very cheap
3) Portable and Reliable
4) Use of PC’s
5) Very small size
6) Pipeline processing
7) No Air Conditioner needed 
8) Concept of internet was introduced
9) Great development in the field of networks
10) Computers became easily available
	Some Computers of this generation are:
1) DEC 10
2) STAR 1000
3) PDP 11
4) CRAY-1 (super computer)</p>
